             One of three base classes for your NUnitForms tests.  This one can be
             used by people who do not need or want "built-in" Assert functionality.
            
             This is the recommended base class for all unit tests that use NUnitForms.  
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             You should probably extend this class to create all of your test fixtures.  The benefit is that
             this class implements setup and teardown methods that clean up after your test.  Any forms that
             are created and displayed during your test are cleaned up by the tear down method.  This base
             class also provides easy access to keyboard and mouse controllers.  It has a method that allows
             you to set up a handler for modal dialog boxes.  It allows your tests to run on a separate 
             (usually hidden) desktop so that they are faster and do not interfere with your normal desktop
             activity.  If you want custom setup and teardown behavior, you should override the virtual 
             Setup and TearDown methods.  Do not use the setup and teardown attributes in your child class.

            <remarks>
            It would be better form to make this private and provide a protected getter property, though
            that could break existing tests.

            This property controls whether the separate hidden desktop is displayed for the duration of
            this test.  You will need to override and return true from this property if your test makes
            use of the keyboard or mouse controllers.  (The hidden desktop cannot accept user input.)  For
            tests that do not use the keyboard and mouse controller (most should not) you don't need to do
            anything with this.  The default behavior is fine.

            This property controls whether a separate desktop is used at all. Tests on the separate desktop
            are faster and safer (there is no danger of keyboard or mouse input going to your own separate 
            running applications).  However, it fails on some systems; also, it is not possible to unlock 
            by hand a blocked test (e.g. due to a modal form). In order to enable it, you can override
            this method from your test class to return true. Or you can set an environment variable called
            "UseHiddenDesktop" and set that to "true".

            Records a single shot modal form handler. The handler receives as arguments the title of the window,
            its handle, and the corresponding form (null if it is not a form, i.e. a dialog box). The handler is
            single shot: it is removed after being run; therefore, if it is expected to trigger a new modal form,
            it should install a new handler before returning. The handler can work on dialog boxes by creating
            a message box tester or file dialog tester, passing the handle of the box (its second argument) to the
            tester's constructor. The tester constructors taking as argument the box title are unreliable and deprecated.

             windows (EnumWindows).  It enumerated 1228 windows.  It then creates a new 
             desktop (hNewDesk = CreateDesktop), changes the thread desktop to the new 
             desktop (SetThreadDesktop(hNewDesk)), and then creates a new window (a 
             button control).  It then enumerates windows again, and this time enumerates 
             only 3 windows (my button plus two others the system must have created for 
             the new desktop).
             
             One thing I found out - you cannot call SetThreadDesktop if the thread (or 
             maybe even the process - not sure) owns a window.  I was creating the button 
             and then calling SetThreadDesktop, but the SetThreadDesktop call failed with 
             0xaa-  the resource is in use or something like that.  I changed the test to 
             create the button *after* calling SetThreadDesktop and that worked fine.
             
             One other thing: your process may not have permission to switch to the other 
             desktop.  I was at first trying to switch to the WinLogon desktop - I should 
             have known better - access denied.  You may have to adjust your 
             permissions/privileges for it to work.  Services can do it (that's primarly 
             who the SetThreadDesktop API was created for), but I think they have to run 
             under local system account to do it.

             Thread Connection to a Desktop
             After a process connects to a window station, the system assigns a desktop to the thread making the connection. The 
             system determines the desktop to assign to the thread according to the following rules:
             
             
             If the thread has called the SetThreadDesktop function, it connects to the specified desktop. 
             If the thread did not call SetThreadDesktop, it connects to the desktop inherited from the parent process. 
             If the thread did not call SetThreadDesktop and did not inherit a desktop, the system attempts to open for MAXIMUM_ALLOWED access and connect to a desktop as follows: 
             
             If a desktop name was specified in the lpDesktop member of the STARTUPINFO structure that was passed to the CreateProcess function when the process was created, the thread connects to the specified desktop. 
             Otherwise, the thread connects to the default desktop of the window station to which the process connected. 
             The desktop assigned during this connection process cannot be closed by calling the CloseDesktop function.
             
             <b>
             When a process is connecting to a desktop, the system searches the process's handle table for inherited 
             handles. The system uses the first desktop handle it finds. If you want a child process to connect to 
             a particular inherited desktop, you must ensure that the only the desired handle is marked inheritable. If a 
             child process inherits multiple desktop handles, the results of the desktop connection are undefined.
             
             Handles to a desktop that the system opens while connecting a process to a desktop are not inheritable.

             <remarks>
              <b>MouseController</b> allows you to control the mouse position 
              and buttons and simulate dragging and clicking during a test.  It can be
              used to test the behavior of a control.  For testing the behavior of an
              application in reponse to a control's events, it is not necessary to use
              the MouseControl.  I suggest you directly fire the appropriate events instead.
              (You probably aren't using this class unless you are writing some custom
              control and need to see its response to actual low level mouse movement, etc..)
              <para>
              The mouse Position can be relative to a <see cref="T:System.Windows.Forms.Form"/> or a <see cref="T:System.Windows.Forms.Control"/> 
              on a <b>Form</b>.  The <b>Position</b> can be specified in pixels, inches or millimetres
              </para>
              <para>
              The mouse buttons are controlled with the PressAndRelease and Release methods.  Both
              methods allow a bitwise combination of the <see cref="T:System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons"/>, for example 
              <c>PressAndRelease(MouseButtons.Left | MouseButtons.Center)</c>.
              Button modifiers, the Alt, Shift and Ctrl keys, are also controlled with the two methods.

              can only be simulated when a mouse with <see cref="P:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.MouseButtons">5 buttons</see> is installed. 
              The <b>PressAndRelease</b> and <b>Release</b> methods will throw <see cref="T:System.NotSupportedException"/> if the XButtons are used 
              when a mouse does not have 4 or 5 button support.

            <summary>
            Specifies the function's purpose. If this parameter is TRUE, keyboard and mouse input events are 
            blocked. If this parameter is FALSE, keyboard and mouse events are unblocked. Note that only 
            the thread that blocked input can successfully unblock input. 
            </summary>
            <param name="blockIt"></param>
            <returns></returns>
            <remarks>
            When input is blocked, real physical input from the mouse or keyboard will not affect the input queue's 
            synchronous key state (reported by GetKeyState and GetKeyboardState), nor will it affect the asynchronous 
            key state (reported by GetAsyncKeyState). However, the thread that is blocking input can affect both of 
            these key states by calling SendInput. No other thread can do this.
            The system will unblock input in the following cases: 
            The thread that blocked input unexpectedly exits without calling BlockUserInput with fBlock set to FALSE. 
            In this case, the system cleans up properly and re-enables input. Windows 95/98/Me: The system displays the
            Close Program/Fault dialog box. This can occur if the thread faults or if the user presses CTRL+ALT+DEL. 
            Windows 2000/XP: The user presses CTRL+ALT+DEL or the system invokes the Hard System Error modal message
            box (for example, when a program faults or a device fails).

            dx
            Specifies the absolute position of the mouse, or the amount of motion since the last mouse event was generated, depending on the value of the dwFlags member. Absolute data is specified as the x coordinate of the mouse; relative data is specified as the number of pixels moved. 
            dy
            Specifies the absolute position of the mouse, or the amount of motion since the last mouse event was generated, depending on the value of the dwFlags member. Absolute data is specified as the y coordinate of the mouse; relative data is specified as the number of pixels moved. 
            mouseData
            If dwFlags contains MOUSEEVENTF_WHEEL, then mouseData specifies the amount of wheel movement. A positive value indicates that the wheel was rotated forward, away from the user; a negative value indicates that the wheel was rotated backward, toward the user. One wheel click is defined as WHEEL_DELTA, which is 120. 
            Windows 2000/XP: IfdwFlags does not contain MOUSEEVENTF_WHEEL, MOUSEEVENTF_XDOWN, or MOUSEEVENTF_XUP, then mouseData should be zero. 
            
            If dwFlags contains MOUSEEVENTF_XDOWN or MOUSEEVENTF_XUP, then mouseData specifies which X buttons were pressed or released. This value may be any combination of the following flags. 
            
            XBUTTON1
            Set if the first X button is pressed or released.
            XBUTTON2
            Set if the second X button is pressed or released.
            dwFlags
            A set of bit flags that specify various aspects of mouse motion and button clicks. The bits in this member can be any reasonable combination of the following values. 
            The bit flags that specify mouse button status are set to indicate changes in status, not ongoing conditions. For example, if the left mouse button is pressed and held down, MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTDOWN is set when the left button is first pressed, but not for subsequent motions. Similarly, MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTUP is set only when the button is first released. 
            
            You cannot specify both the MOUSEEVENTF_WHEEL flag and either MOUSEEVENTF_XDOWN or MOUSEEVENTF_XUP flags simultaneously in the dwFlags parameter, because they both require use of the mouseData field. 
            
            MOUSEEVENTF_ABSOLUTE
            Specifies that the dx and dy members contain normalized absolute coordinates. If the flag is not set, dxand dy contain relative data (the change in position since the last reported position). This flag can be set, or not set, regardless of what kind of mouse or other pointing device, if any, is connected to the system. For further information about relative mouse motion, see the following Remarks section.
            MOUSEEVENTF_MOVE
            Specifies that movement occurred.
            MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTDOWN
            Specifies that the left button was pressed.
            MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTUP
            Specifies that the left button was released.
            MOUSEEVENTF_RIGHTDOWN
            Specifies that the right button was pressed.
            MOUSEEVENTF_RIGHTUP
            Specifies that the right button was released.
            MOUSEEVENTF_MIDDLEDOWN
            Specifies that the middle button was pressed.
            MOUSEEVENTF_MIDDLEUP
            Specifies that the middle button was released.
            MOUSEEVENTF_VIRTUALDESK
            Windows 2000/XP:Maps coordinates to the entire desktop. Must be used with MOUSEEVENTF_ABSOLUTE.
            MOUSEEVENTF_WHEEL
            Windows NT/2000/XP: Specifies that the wheel was moved, if the mouse has a wheel. The amount of movement is specified in mouseDataÃ‚Â .
            MOUSEEVENTF_XDOWN
            Windows 2000/XP: Specifies that an X button was pressed.
            MOUSEEVENTF_XUP
            Windows 2000/XP: Specifies that an X button was released.
            time
            Time stamp for the event, in milliseconds. If this parameter is 0, the system will provide its own time stamp.
